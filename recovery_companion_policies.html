      <h4>Overview</h4>
      <p>Recovery Companion (“the App”) helps people track sobriety, discover meetings, and engage with supportive tools.
        We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about how we handle your data.</p>

      <h4>Data We Collect</h4>

        <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> Email address and password (hashed) when you create an account.</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Details (optional):</strong> Display name, avatar image, and basic preferences you choose to provide.</li>
        <li><strong>App Content:</strong> Sobriety dates and milestones, journal entries, favorites, reactions, and forum posts you create.</li>

        <li><strong>Location (optional):</strong> If you grant location permission, we use it to help find nearby meetings. You can revoke permission at any time in your device settings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Sources of Meeting Data</h4>
      <p>The App aggregates meeting information from public and partner sources (e.g., AA/TSML, NA/BMLT, and other organizations).
        Meeting records may include venue names, addresses, schedules, formats, and publicly listed links (e.g., Zoom).
        If any listing is inaccurate, please email us and we will review it promptly.</p>

      <h4>How We Use Data</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide core features: sobriety tracking, meeting discovery, journaling, and community interactions.</li>
        <li>Maintain safety, prevent abuse, and comply with applicable laws.</li>

          Vendors only process data on our instructions and under confidentiality obligations.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information where required by law or to protect the rights, safety, and security of users and the public.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Data Storage & Security</h4>
      <p>Your account data and app content are stored with reputable cloud providers and protected using industry-standard security practices.

      <h4>Retention</h4>
      <p>We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide the App and comply with legal obligations.
