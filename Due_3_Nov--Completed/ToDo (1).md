# **Level 1: The Single Page**

This first step is about creating the most basic version of our website: a single, local HTML file.

ToDo

1. Create a new folder for the project.  
2. Inside the folder, create a file named index.html.  
3. Add a single \<h1\> heading tag to the file.

## **Level 2: A Structured Project**

Now, we'll create a more organized folder structure that is standard for web projects and link a stylesheet.

ToDo

1. Create css and js sub-folders inside your project directory.  
2. Create an empty styles.css file inside the css folder.  
3. Add standard HTML boilerplate code to index.html.  
4. Link the styles.css stylesheet in the index.html file.

### **Level 3: The Multi-Page Site Shell & Version Control**

Let's expand the site with more pages and start tracking our changes with Git. This is a crucial step for managing project history.

ToDo

1. Create an additional HTML file: about.html.  
2. Initialize a Git repository in the project folder.  
3. Add all the files and make your first commit, bundling all the work from Levels 1, 2, and 3\.

### **Level 4: Professional Repository Setup**

A professional repository includes documentation and ignores unnecessary files. We'll also add basic navigation to link our pages together.

ToDo

1. Create a README.md file for project documentation.  
2. Create a .gitignore file to exclude unwanted files (like node\_modules or .DS\_Store).  
3. Commit these two files.  
4. Add a basic navigation section to all three HTML pages.  
5. Commit the navigation changes.
