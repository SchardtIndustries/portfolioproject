    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I’m Matthew Schardt, a project manager in the energy sector and a current student at Carnegie Mellon University, 
      pursuing advanced coursework in software development and systems design. My background in managing large-scale technical 
      projects has built my foundation in coordination, process optimization, and cross-disciplinary collaboration — skills I now 
      apply directly to building software that empowers people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work, I’m developing Recovery Companion, a mobile application I’m building independently as a full-stack project. 
      The app supports people in addiction recovery through journaling tools, milestone tracking, and community-driven support features. 
      It’s built with React Native (Expo) on the frontend, Supabase for authentication and database services, and PostgreSQL for secure, scalable 
      data management — all designed, coded, and deployed by me.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m passionate about merging structured project management with creative problem-solving in technology. My long-term goal is to bridge my experience in energy and operations with software that makes systems — and lives — run more efficiently
