    <h1>About Schardt Industries</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Schardt Industries</strong> is a focused software studio that designs and builds
      custom internal tools, employee portals, and mobile apps for teams that need their software
      to match the way they actually work. The studio is led by
      <strong>Matthew Schardt</strong>, who combines real-world operations experience with
      hands-on engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      The mission of Schardt Industries is simple: take the kinds of workflows that usually live in
      paper forms, text threads, and spreadsheets, and turn them into reliable, purpose-built
      systems. That includes everything from workforce management tools like the
      <strong>KWS Employee Portal</strong> to public, recovery-focused products like
      <strong>Recovery Companion</strong> on iOS and Android.
    </p>

    <p>
      Projects are intentionally scoped and delivered with a strong emphasis on clarity,
      maintainability, and long-term usefulness. The goal isn’t just to ship a proof of concept,
      but to put a dependable tool in people’s hands that earns its keep every day.
    </p>

    <h2>About the founder</h2>

    <p>
      I’m <strong>Matthew Schardt</strong>, a project manager in the energy sector and a software
      developer. My background includes coordinating field operations, safety requirements, and
      tight schedules—work where small details matter and systems have to hold up in the real
      world. Those same principles guide how I design and build software.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m also a current student at <strong>Carnegie Mellon University</strong>, where I continue
      to build on my engineering foundations and stay current with modern development practices.
      Schardt Industries is where that formal training meets years of hands-on operations
      experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      Recent work includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Recovery Companion</strong> &mdash; a mobile app for people in addiction recovery,
        featuring meeting search, sobriety tracking, craving-management tools, and community
        features.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>KWS Employee Portal</strong> &mdash; an internal workforce management platform for
        Killion &amp; Sons Well Service, supporting scheduling, safety paperwork, incident
        reporting, and employee resources.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Whether it’s a new internal tool, an operations dashboard, or a public-facing app, I approach
      each project with the same mindset: understand the real constraints, design a clear workflow,
      and ship software that people actually want to use.

      <h2>Mission & Values</h2>

      <p>
        Schardt Industries was founded with a simple belief: software should make life easier, not more
        complicated. The studio exists to build tools that meaningfully improve how people work and live,
        without exploiting their data or forcing them into bloated systems they don’t need.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mission is to create clear, reliable, purpose-built software that helps people accomplish
        difficult tasks more easily—whether that’s running field operations, managing safety workflows,
        or supporting communities through mobile tools like Recovery Companion. Every project is guided
        by a commitment to transparency, respect for user privacy, and a deep understanding of
        real-world challenges.
      </p>

      <h3>Core Values</h3>
      <ul style="max-width:720px; margin:0 auto; text-align:left;">
        <li>
          <strong>Simplicity with purpose</strong> — Software should solve real problems and make hard
          tasks easier, not bury users in unnecessary layers or complexity.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Privacy by default</strong> — Schardt Industries does not work with data brokers and
          does not design systems that exploit user information. People deserve tools they can trust.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Honesty & transparency</strong> — Clear expectations, straightforward communication,
          and truthful conversations about scope, value, and feasibility.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Solution-based development</strong> — Every project begins with understanding the
          real workflow or challenge behind the request, ensuring that what gets built actually helps.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Sustainable results</strong> — Tools should be maintainable, reliable, and built for
          long-term use, not quick fixes that create problems down the road.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>People-first software</strong> — Whether for field teams, office staff, or app users
          seeking support, the goal is always the same: make life better for the people using the tool.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>A future-focused studio</strong> — Schardt Industries aims to grow into a transparent,
          people-centered development team working together to make technology more humane and more
          useful.
