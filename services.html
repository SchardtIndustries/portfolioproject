      <h1>Services & Process</h1>
      <p>
        Schardt Industries designs and builds custom software for teams that need more than generic
        off-the-shelf tools. I focus on internal tools, workforce apps, and operational software that
        support the way your business actually runs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every project combines <strong>project management discipline</strong> with
        <strong>hands-on engineering</strong>, from first conversation through deployment and support.

          <h3>Internal employee portals & operations tools</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            Custom portals for scheduling, safety paperwork, incident reporting, approvals, and
            day-to-day operations. These tools are designed around your roles, job sites, and
            workflows—not someone else’s template.

        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>Mobile apps (iOS &amp; Android)</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            Cross-platform mobile apps built with a single shared codebase and deployed to both
            the Apple App Store and Google Play. Ideal for field teams, customers, or communities
            that need access on the go.

        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>Web apps & dashboards</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            Browser-based tools for coordinators and leadership: live data views, admin consoles,
            and dashboards that bring together the information you need to run day-to-day operations.

          <h3>Architecture & technical consulting</h3>

            If you already have systems in place, I can help with architecture reviews, feasibility
            planning, and scoped feature work to extend or stabilize what you’re running today.

      <h2>How the process works</h2>
      <div class="project-gallery">
        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>1. Discovery & scoping</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            We start with a focused conversation about your team, existing tools, and the problems
            you’re trying to solve. You’ll share examples of paperwork, spreadsheets, or systems you
            use today. From that, I create a written scope with proposed features and constraints.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>2. Proposal & alignment</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            Based on the scope, I provide a proposed approach, rough timelines, and pricing ranges.
            This is where we decide which features are in the first release, and which items can be
            deferred to later phases if needed.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>3. Build in small, testable pieces</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            I implement the solution in small increments with regular check-ins. You see working
            software early, so there are fewer surprises at the end and more chances to refine the fit
            to your real-world workflow.
          </p>
        </article>

        <article class="project-card">
          <h3>4. Launch, train, and support</h3>
          <p class="project-desc">
            Once we’re ready to launch, I handle deployment and provide reasonable post-launch
            support. The goal is to give your team a tool they can rely on—not a proof of concept
            that gets abandoned after a month.

          <p class="project-desc">
            Electron-based desktop tools when a persistent Windows or desktop experience makes more
