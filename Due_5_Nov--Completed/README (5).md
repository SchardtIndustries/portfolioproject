# **Lab: Applying Styles & The Box Model**

* **Level 1: Basic Styling**  
  * **Tasks:** Link your styles.css file. Use **element selectors** (h1, p) to set a default font family and color for the entire page.  
  * **Outcome:** A page with consistent, basic typography and color, moving away from the browser's default look.  
* **Level 2: Class-based Styling**  
  * **Tasks:** Create and apply **class selectors** (e.g., .nav-link, .project-card) to style specific, reusable elements. Give your header and footer distinct background colors.  
  * **Outcome:** A site with a clear visual hierarchy and styled sections.  
* **Level 3: Mastering the Box Model**  
  * **Tasks:** Use **padding** to give your content sections breathing room. Add **margins** between elements like project cards or paragraphs to create clear separation. Place a **border** around a key element, like your profile picture.  
  * **Outcome:** A well-spaced, clean layout that is easy to read and navigate.  
* **Level 4: Themed Design**  
  * **Tasks:** Select a professional color palette (2-3 colors) and a font pairing (one for headings, one for body text). Apply this theme consistently across all pages of your portfolio. Commit your styling changes to Git with a message like "feat: Add base styling and theme".  
  * **Outcome:** A portfolio with a cohesive and intentional design theme, with all changes tracked in Git.  
* **Level 5: Advanced Selectors & Dev Tools Debugging**  
  * **Tasks:** Use more advanced selectors, like attribute selectors (input\[type="text"\]) or pseudo-classes (a:hover), to add subtle interactive feedback. Intentionally create a spacing issue and use the browser's **developer tools** to inspect the Box Model, diagnose the problem, and fix it.  
  * **Outcome:** A polished and interactive design, and the foundational skill of debugging CSS visually using professional tools.
