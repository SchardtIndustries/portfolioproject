# **Step 1: Basic Styling**

We'll start by moving away from the browser's default styles and setting a new baseline for typography and color.

## **ToDo**

1. Confirm that styles.css is linked in all HTML files.  
2. Use element selectors (body, h1, p, a, etc.) to set a default font family, text color, and background color.

### **Step 2: Class-based Styling**

Element selectors are good for general rules, but class selectors give us the power to style specific, reusable components. Here, we'll style the main sections of our pages.

## **ToDo**

1. Create and apply classes to structure the page layout (e.g., a container for centered content).  
2. Give the header/navigation area a distinct background color to separate it from the main content.

### **Step 3: Mastering the Box Model**

The CSS Box Model is fundamental to web layout. We will use padding, margin, and border to control spacing and create a clean, organized layout.

**ToDo**

1. Use padding to give the navigation list some internal spacing.  
2. Use margin to create separation between headings and paragraphs.  
3. Add a border to a placeholder element, which will eventually be a profile picture.

### **Step 4: Themed Design & Commit**

A consistent theme makes a portfolio look professional. We will now formally define our color palette and font pairing and apply it across the site.

**ToDo**

1. Select a professional color palette and a font pairing.  
2. Import fonts from a service like Google Fonts.  
3. Apply this theme consistently across all pages.  
4. Commit all the styling work from the four Steps with a descriptive message.

### **Step 5: Advanced Selectors & Dev Tools Debugging**

Let's add some subtle interactivity and learn the essential skill of debugging CSS with browser developer tools.

**ToDo**

1. Use a pseudo-class (:hover) to add feedback to navigation links.  
2. Intentionally create a spacing issue.  
3. Use the browser's developer tools to inspect the box model, find the problem, and fix it.
